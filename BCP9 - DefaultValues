/*Default Values
As a breeder, deciding upon the dogs' names is tough! So unless someone names my dog, I always name it Steve.
Write a function called dogBreeder that takes a name and an age and returns a dog object with those properties attached to it. 
If someone fails to put a name in, default to Steve. If someone fails to put an age in, default to 0.
Be careful though, sometimes the people using our function might not have nice input! (you guys asked for it!).

function dogBreeder(name, age) {

  if(arguments.length === 1) {
    age = name;   
    name = "Steve";
  }
  
  var Obj = {
  
    dogName: name,
    dogAge: age
  }; 
 
  return Obj;
}

//dogBreeder("Sam", 12)    // => {name: 'Sam', age: 12}
dogBreeder(15);    // => {name:'Steve', age: 15}
