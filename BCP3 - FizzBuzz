/*
Fizz buzz is a classic programming challenge. Write a function that accepts a single number as an argument. Count up to that number logging "Fizz" for any numbers that are divisible by 3, "Buzz" for any numbers that are divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for any numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

Bonus: Write the function without ever using equality comparison operators (== or ===). Hint: You'll have to use coercion and truthy/falsey.

function fizzBuzz (num) {

  for(var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {  
    if (i % 15 === 0) {
      console.log("FizzBuzz");
      
    } else if(i%3 === 0) {
      console.log("Fizz"); 
    
    } else if(i%5 === 0) {
      console.log("Buzz");
      
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}
