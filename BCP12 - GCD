/*Greatest Common Divisor
In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) for a set of numbers is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.
Write a function that accepts two positive integers and recursively computes (and returns) the greatest common divisor.

To compute gcd(48,18), divide 48 by 18 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 12. Then divide 18 by 12 to get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6. Then divide 12 by 6 to get a remainder of 0, which means that 6 is the gcd. Note that we ignored the quotient in each step except to notice when the remainder reached 0, signalling that we had arrived at the answer.

gcd(48, 18)    // => 6
