/*
Practice scope and IIFEs by predicting whether 'Bond (007)' is in the scope!
Paste the function below in a repl, but DO NOT RUN THE CODE YET.
Look at each of the Bond Villain IIFEs inside the badGuys function. For each villain, write a prediction about whether Bond (007) will be defined in the function's scope. Finally, run the functions, and consider why or why not your predictions matched.
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
