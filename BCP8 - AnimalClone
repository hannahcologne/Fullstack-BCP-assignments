Write a cloneAnimal function that takes an animal and returns a "clone" of that animal. The clone should be of the same species, but should have no offspring. The clone's name should be the parent's name, with "Clone" appended to the end.
Your cloneAnimal function should also add the clone's name to the parent's offspring array.
